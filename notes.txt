You have to fit the model with the same format of your images
you can use batches:
    Stocastic batches are 1 by 1
    SKLearn is going to accept the same format for all of your images
    PyTorch - the input can be dynamic. Don't all need to be the same size
    Except all images in the batch need to be the same
